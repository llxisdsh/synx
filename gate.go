// Gate is a synchronization primitive that can be manually opened and closed,
// and supports a "pulse" operation to wake up current waiters without keeping the gate open.
//
// It conceptually models a physical gate:
//   - Open: The gate is open. Waiters pass immediately.
//   - Close: The gate is closed. Waiters block until Open or Pulse.
//   - Pulse: The gate remains closed, but all currently blocked waiters are allowed to pass.
//     Future waiters will block.
//
// It is zero-value usable (starts Closed).
//
// Size: 16 bytes (8 byte state + 2*4 byte sema).
